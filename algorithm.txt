Ask what package they use
    Error check the package to make sure user chose a correct option
Ask the user how much data they used
If the user has a blue package,
    If the user used over 4GB of data,
        Subtract 4GB from the user's data usage
        Multiply the additional GB by $10 to get the additional costs
        The user's monthly bill is $70 plus the additional costs
    Otherwise,
        Their monthly bill is $70
Otherwise, if the user chose the purple package,
    The user's monthly bill is $99.95
Otherwise,
        If the user uses more than 2GB,
            Subtract 2GB from their data usage
            Multiply $15 by the additional GB left to get the additional cost
            Add the additional cost to the $49.99 to calculate their monthly bill
            If the bill is greater than or equal to $75
                Ask them if they have a coupon
                Error check for their input
                                If they do,
                                    Take $20 off of their monthly  bill
        Otherwise,
            The user's monthly bill is $49.99
